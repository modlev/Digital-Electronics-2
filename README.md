**Project Objectives:**

Project objective is to create description of 4x3 keyboard control and in this project must be included an application of door lock system, display, door unlock relay, own library for keypad scanning, time limit for entering the correct 4-digit code, signaling of entering the wrong code, time delay for re-locking the lock approx. Another objective is to create a code on AtmelStudio for the door lock, so it would function properly. Also the project consist of simulations of the system.

**Hardware description**

We used SimulIDE for our scheme. The scheme consist of:
-LCD display - shows to the user the status of situation. If the password is written incorrectly then the word "Incorrect" lights up on LCD;
-AVR microcontroller Atmega328 - is meant to control the whole system;
-4x3 keyboard - is used for the intput of the password;
-Audio output device - this hardware device is used to alert the user, that a wrong password was entered;
-Relay - is used to unlock the door;
-BJT transistor - is used as a switch, to unlock the door;
-Fix voltage - used as a power source;
-LED's - there are Red and Green LED's. Red one signal that a wrong password was entered and the Green one signal that a right password was entered;
-Resistors - are used to lower the current;
-Grounds - are used to end the circuit.
